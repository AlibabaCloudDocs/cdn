# Overview

Beginning January 8, 2021, Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\) uses the pay-by-data-transfer metering method by default. After Alibaba Cloud CDN is activated, you cannot manually change the metering method in the Alibaba Cloud CDN console.

If Business Type is set to **DCDN** when you add a domain name to Alibaba Cloud CDN, you canview and manage the domain name in the [Dynamic Route for DCDN \(DCDN\) console](https://account.alibabacloud.com/login/login.htm). **DCDN**-accelerated domain names that are managed in the Alibaba Cloud CDN console are billed based on the billing rules of DCDN. If you have purchased a resource plan of Alibaba Cloud CDN or DCDN, the resource plan can be shared between Alibaba Cloud CDN and DCDN. You can use the resource plan to offset data transfer fees generated by outbound network traffic and HTTPS requests for static content. For more information, see [What is Dynamic Route for CDN?]()
