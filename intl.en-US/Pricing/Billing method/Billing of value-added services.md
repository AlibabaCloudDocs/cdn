# Billing of value-added services

This topic describes the billable items and billing rules for value-added services of Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\).

## HTTPS requests for static content

After you enable HTTPS in the [Alibaba Cloud CDN console](https://account.alibabacloud.com/login/login.htm), you are charged for HTTPS requests that request static content. For more information, see [CDN Pricing](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/cdn/pricing).

## QUIC requests

After you enable QUIC in the [Alibaba Cloud CDN console](https://account.alibabacloud.com/login/login.htm), you are charged for QUIC requests. For more information, see [Value-added services - QUIC requests](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/cdn/pricing).

**Note:** By default, Alibaba Cloud CDN does not generate billing details about requests for dynamic content. Therefore, Alibaba Cloud CDN does not include QUIC requests for dynamic content in the billable items. If a domain name uses Dynamic Route for CDN \(DCDN\) to accelerate content delivery and requests for dynamic content are generated, billing details about these requests are generated.

## Real-time log delivery

To use this feature,log on to the [Alibaba Cloud CDN console](https://account.alibabacloud.com/login/login.htm) and choose **Logs** \> **Real-time Logging** in the left-side navigation pane. You are charged for the number of log entries. For more information, see [Value-added services - Real-time log delivery](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/cdn/pricing).
