# What is Alibaba Cloud CDN? {#concept_aml_tlg_tdb .concept}

Content Delivery Network \(CDN\) is built on a bearer network that uses a distributed architecture of edge node clusters located in different regions. CDN offloads traffic from origins to prevent network congestion, thereby accelerating web content distribution in different regions and various scenarios while increasing resource access speed.

Alibaba Cloud CDN caches the resources from origins to the accelerating nodes that are distributed across the globe. When a user requests access to such resources, the system does not need to direct the requests to the origin that serves the user. Instead, the system automatically obtains the resources cached on the CDN node closest to the user. For information about how to connect to Alibaba Cloud CDN, see [Quick start](../../../../intl.en-US/Quick Start/Quick start.md#).

Some CDN nodes support access through IPv6 addresses.
