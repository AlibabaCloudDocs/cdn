# SCDN

If your website is vulnerable to attacks but requires delivery acceleration, we recommend that you use Secure Content Delivery Network \(SCDN\) to secure your workloads.

## Scenarios

SCDN applies to scenarios that require both content delivery acceleration and high security. SCDN is especially suitable for industries, such as gaming, finance, government and enterprise security, e-commerce, and healthcare. SCDN mitigates network attacks for these industries. SCDN accelerates content delivery, secures data transmitted over CDN, and improves user experience.

## Issues resolved

-   The use of Content Delivery Network \(CDN\) without security protections cannot secure your workloads.
-   Anti-DDoS solutions without Alibaba Cloud CDN cannot accelerate content delivery.
-   If Anti-DDoS Pro and Anti-DDoS Premium instances identify and filter requests for content before CDN processes these requests, content delivery cannot be accelerated.
-   Bottlenecks may occur if multiple clients simultaneously request resources from origin servers across networks.
-   Multiple issues may be caused by malicious bot traffic, such as network traffic consumption, sensitive data theft, and downgraded service performance.
