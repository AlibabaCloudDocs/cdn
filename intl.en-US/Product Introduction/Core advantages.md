# Core advantages

This topic describes the core advantages of Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\) to help you make informed decisions.

Alibaba Cloud CDN provides a wide variety of integrated features, advanced technologies, cost-effective pricing, diversified ecosystem, and comprehensive support to boost your business at minimal costs.

## Product competitiveness

**Optimal performance**

-   Alibaba Cloud CDN has the largest number of CDN nodes for content delivery acceleration in mainland China. Alibaba Cloud has deployed more than 2,300 CDN nodes in mainland China and over 500 CDN nodes across regions outside of mainland China. For more information, see [Node distribution](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Node distribution.md).
-   The bandwidth capacity of Alibaba Cloud CDN far outweighs that of other similar CDN products in mainland China. The bandwidth capacity of any single CDN node exceeds 40 Gbit/s, and the total bandwidth capacity of all CDN nodes in mainland China is 130 Tbit/s.
-   Excellent key performance metrics ensure optimal user experience. Alibaba Cloud CDN provides a cache hit ratio of over 95%, with response times measured in milliseconds, and over 95% smoothness rate for accelerated video delivery. For more information, see [Common performance indicators](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Why choose Alibaba Cloud CDN?.md).

**Ease of use**

Alibaba Cloud CDN can accelerate content delivery in a variety of scenarios, such as downloads of small and large files, on-demand video and audio streaming, live streaming media, Dynamic Route for CDN \(DCDN\), and Secure Content Delivery Network \(SCDN\). You can easily customize CDN to fit your needs by using EdgeScript. Alibaba Cloud CDN has been popular for the achievements brought to the customers. For more information, see [Case studies for CDN](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Case studies for CDN.md) and [Alibaba Cloud safeguards AirAsia seasonal promotions](/intl.en-US/Successful Cases/Alibaba Cloud safeguards AirAsia seasonal promotions.md).

-   The [CDN console](https://cdn.console.aliyun.com/overview) provides a graphical overview of the features provided and simplifies management. For more information, see [Domain Management](/intl.en-US/Domain Management/Features.md) and [Service Management](/intl.en-US/Service Management/Overview.md).
-   You can use EdgeScript to customize CDN to fit your needs and shorten the time to release custom features. For more information, see [Overview of EdgeScript](/intl.en-US/EdgeScript/Introduction/Overview.md).

## Technological competitiveness

-   Advanced infrastructure: Linux Virtual Server \(LVS\) is used for Layer-4 load balancing and Tengine for Layer-7 load balancing. The HTTP caching protocol is written in Swift.
-   Rich API operations: In addition to using the console, you can manage the CDN service by calling specific API operations. We recommend that you use the latest API operations. For more information, see [New API Reference](/intl.en-US/New API Reference/Overview.md).
-   SDKs for multiple languages: SDK guides are available to instruct you to download, install, and use Alibaba Cloud SDKs. For more information, see [SDK for Java](https://develop.aliyun.com/tools/sdk?java#/java), [SDK for Python](https://develop.aliyun.com/tools/sdk?java#/python), [SDK for PHP](https://develop.aliyun.com/tools/sdk?java#/php), [SDK for .NET](https://develop.aliyun.com/tools/sdk?java#/dotnet), [SDK for C or C++](https://develop.aliyun.com/tools/sdk?java#/c), and [SDK for Go](https://develop.aliyun.com/tools/sdk?java#/go).

After the CNAME record takes effect, Alibaba Cloud CDN can accelerate access to the accelerated domain name. For more information, see [Add a domain name for CDN](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Add a domain.md) and [Configure a CNAME record in Alibaba Cloud DNS](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Configure a CNAME record/Configure a CNAME record in Alibaba Cloud DNS.md).

## Recommended billing methods and resource plans

Alibaba Cloud CDN supports multiple billing methods and resource plans that are applicable to different scenarios. The following recommendations allow you to select the optimal billing methods and resource plans.

|Scenario|Recommended billing method or resource plan|
|--------|-------------------------------------------|
|A small part of the bandwidth capacity is consumed by requests for the content from origin servers, but a large amount of network traffic is incurred during acceleration.|Pay-by-bandwidth.|
|A small amount of network traffic is incurred during the acceleration of content delivery for origin servers, but spikes in bandwidth usage occur during certain periods of time.|Pay-by-data-transfer. **Note:** We recommend that you purchase [resource plans](https://common-buy.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.8064714.323101.1.720cSlWXSlWXoT&commodityCode=dcdnpaybag#/buy) to minimize the costs. These resource plans apply to multiple accelerated regions and data transfer plans that support the total amount of transferred data ranging from 100 GB to 50 PB to meet your different requirements. |
|You have enabled HTTPS and the delivery of content from origin servers is accelerated over HTTPS.|[Resource plans of dynamic and static HTTPS requests](https://common-buy.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.8064714.323101.1.720cSlWXSlWXoT&commodityCode=dcdnpaybag#/buy). The fees incurred by dynamic and static HTTPS requests are offset based on the priority of the resource plans. If the quotas provided by the resource plans are exceeded, extra fees for dynamic and static HTTPS requests are charged based on the pay-as-you-go billing method.|
|If a large amount of images are delivered through CDN every day, you can enable adult content recognition to monitor and filter adult content.|[Adult content recognition resource plans](https://common-buy.aliyun.com/?commodityCode=cdnpornbag#/buy). Multiple adult content recognition resource plans are available. The resources plans support the total number of processed images that range from 500,000 to 500,000,000.|
|If your monthly fee is higher than CNY 100,000.00,|Alibaba Cloud CDN provides you with a monthly 95th percentile bandwidth billing method. For more information, contact Alibaba Cloud customer service.|
