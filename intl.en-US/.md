# Rules for disabling accelerated domain names

You can disable an accelerated domain name that is added to Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\). In some scenarios, accelerated domain names are disabled by Alibaba Cloud CDN due to violations of Terms of Service, overdue payments, or invalid Internet Content Provider \(ICP\) numbers. This topic describes the causes of disabled domain names and how to enable the domain names again.

## Violations of Terms of Service

**Problem**: An accelerated domain name is disabled because it does not comply with the [Limits](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Limits.md) that Alibaba Cloud imposes on domain names. In this case, the accelerated domain name is disabled. The system notifies you through SMS messages or emails.

**Impacts**: Alibaba Cloud CDN deletes the Canonical Name \(CNAME\) that is assigned to the accelerated domain name and stops resolving the accelerated domain name to a valid IP address. In this case, the accelerated domain name is inaccessible and added to the blacklist. You cannot add the domain name to Alibaba Cloud CDN again.

**Solution**: Make sure that the accelerated domain name complies with the [Limits](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Limits.md) that Alibaba Cloud imposes on domain names. Then, [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.2020520001.aliyun_topbar.18.dbd44bd3e4f845#/ticket/createIndex) to enable the accelerated domain name.

## Overdue payments

**Problem**: The balance, including credit balances and coupons, in your Alibaba Cloud account is insufficient to complete overdue payments. In this case, the system notifies you of overdue payments through SMS messages or emails.

**Impacts**:

-   In normal cases: An accelerated domain name is mapped to a CNAME assigned by Alibaba Cloud CDN. The CNAME is resolved to the IP address of a CDN node.
-   Within 30 days \(720 hours\) after an overdue payment occurs: The system notifies you of the overdue payment through SMS messages or emails, and Alibaba Cloud CDN immediately disables the accelerated domain name. Content delivery acceleration is suspended for the accelerated domain name. The state of the accelerated domain name is changed to OFFLINE. The accelerated domain name remains in this state for 30 days. During the 30 days, the accelerated domain name is mapped to its CNAME. The CNAME is resolved to the IP address of the origin server. In this case, the number of requests that are redirected to the origin server is increased.
-   30 days \(720 hours\) after the accelerated domain name is disabled due to an overdue payment: The system stops resolving the accelerated domain name to the IP address of the origin server. The accelerated domain name is mapped to its CNAME, which is resolved to an invalid IP address offline.\*\*\*.com. In this case, the accelerated domain name is inaccessible.

**Solution**: Complete overdue payments. Then, the accelerated domain name is automatically enabled.

## Invalid ICP numbers

**Problem**: When the ICP number of an accelerated domain name becomes invalid, the system sends SMS messages or emails to notify you of the invalid ICP number.

**Note:**

-   The ICP number of a domain name becomes invalid if the information about the ICP filing entity changes. The information includes but is not limited to the ICP number owner, contact information, service provider, website, and website services. If a change is made to the information, the ICP number becomes invalid.
-   If the accelerated region includes mainland China, you must apply for an ICP number for the accelerated domain name.

**Impacts**:

-   In normal cases: An accelerated domain name is mapped to a CNAME assigned by Alibaba Cloud CDN. The CNAME is resolved to the IP address of a CDN node.
-   Within 30 days \(720 hours\) after the ICP number of the accelerated domain name becomes invalid: Alibaba Cloud CDN immediately disables the accelerated domain name. Content delivery acceleration is suspended for the accelerated domain name. The state of the accelerated domain name is changed to OFFLINE. The accelerated domain name remains in this state for 30 days. During the 30 days, the accelerated domain name is mapped to the CNAME. The CNAME is resolved to the IP address of the origin server.
-   30 days \(720 hours\) after the accelerated domain name is disabled due to its invalid ICP number: The system stops resolving the accelerated domain name to the IP address of the origin server. The accelerated domain name is mapped to its CNAME, which is resolved to an invalid IP address offline.\*\*\*.com. In this case, the accelerated domain name is inaccessible.

**Solution**: Apply for an ICP number for the accelerated domain name. Then, [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.2020520001.aliyun_topbar.18.dbd44bd3e4f845#/ticket/createIndex) to enable the accelerated domain name.

## Manually enable or disable an accelerated domain name

**Problem**: You can manually disable an accelerated domain name. After an accelerated domain name is disabled, the state of the accelerated domain name is changed to OFFLINE. Procedure:

On the Domain Names page, select the accelerated domain name that you want to disable, and click **Disable**.

**Impacts**:

-   In normal cases: An accelerated domain name is mapped to a CNAME assigned by Alibaba Cloud CDN. The CNAME is resolved to the IP address of a CDN node.
-   Impacts: After you disable an accelerated domain name, content delivery acceleration is immediately suspended for the accelerated domain name. The accelerated domain name is mapped to its CNAME, which is resolved to an invalid IP address.

**Solution**: Manually enable the accelerated domain name that is in the OFFLINE state. Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud CDN console](https://account.alibabacloud.com/login/login.htm), and click Domain Names in the left-side navigation pane. On the Domain Names page, select the accelerated domain name that you want to enable, and click **Enable**.
