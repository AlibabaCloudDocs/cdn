# Rules for disabling accelerated domain names

You can disable an accelerated domain name that is added to Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\). In some scenarios, accelerated domain names are disabled by Alibaba Cloud CDN due to violations of Terms of Service, overdue payments, or invalid Internet Content Provider \(ICP\) numbers. This topic describes the causes of disabled domain names and how to enable the domain names again.

## Violations of Terms of Service

**Problem description**: An accelerated domain name is disabled because it does not comply with the [Limits](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Limits.md) that Alibaba Cloud imposes on domain names. In this case, the accelerated domain name is disabled. The system sends notifications to you through SMS messages or emails.

**Impacts**: Alibaba Cloud CDN deletes the Canonical Name \(CNAME\) that is assigned to the accelerated domain name and stops resolving the accelerated domain name. In this case, the accelerated domain name is inaccessible and added to the blacklist. You cannot add the domain name to Alibaba Cloud CDN again in the Alibaba Cloud CDN console.

**Solution**: Make sure that the accelerated domain name complies with the [Limits](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Limits.md) that Alibaba Cloud imposes on domain names. Then, [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.2020520001.aliyun_topbar.18.dbd44bd3e4f845#/ticket/createIndex) to enable the accelerated domain name.

## Overdue payments

**Problem description**: The balance, including credit balances and coupons, in your Alibaba Cloud account is insufficient to complete overdue payments.In this case, the system sends you SMS messages or emails to notify you of overdue payments.

**Impacts**:

-   In normal cases: An accelerated domain name is mapped to a CNAME assigned by Alibaba Cloud CDN. The CNAME is resolved to the IP address of a CDN node.
-   Within the next 30 days \(720 hours\) after an accelerated domain name is disabled due to an overdue payment: When you receive SMS messages or emails that notify you of the overdue payment, Alibaba Cloud CDN immediately disables the accelerated domain name. The state of the accelerated domain name is changed to OFFLINE. Within the next 30 days \(720 hours\) after an accelerated domain name is disabled, the accelerated domain name is mapped to the CNAME. The CNAME is resolved to the address of the origin server.
-   30 days \(720 hours\) after an accelerated domain name is disabled due to an overdue payment: The system stops resolving the accelerated domain name to the origin server. The accelerated domain name is mapped to its CNAME, which is resolved to an invalid IP addressoffline.\*\*\*.com. In this case, the domain name is inaccessible.

**Solution**: Complete overdue payments. Then, you must manually enable the domain name that is in the OFFLINE state.

## Invalid ICP numbers

**Problem description**: When the ICP number of an accelerated domain name becomes invalid, the system sends SMS messages or emails to notify you of the invalid ICP number.

**Note:**

-   The ICP number of a domain name becomes invalid if the information about the ICP filing entity changes. The information includes but is not limited to the ICP number owner, contact information, service provider, website, and website services. If a change is made to the information, the ICP number becomes invalid.
-   If the accelerated region includes mainland China, you must apply for an ICP number for the accelerated domain name.

**Impacts**:

-   In normal cases: An accelerated domain name is mapped to a CNAME assigned by Alibaba Cloud CDN. The CNAME is resolved to the IP address of a CDN node.
-   Within the next 7 days \(168 hours\) after an accelerated domain name is disabled due to its invalid ICP number: If the ICP number of an accelerated domain name becomes invalid, Alibaba Cloud CDN disables the accelerated domain name. The state of the accelerated domain name is changed to OFFLINE. Within the next 7 days \(168 hours\) after an accelerated domain name is disabled, the accelerated domain name is mapped to its CNAME. The CNAME is resolved to the address of the origin server.
-   7 days \(168 hours\) after an accelerated domain name is disabled due to its invalid ICP number: The system stops resolving the accelerated domain name to the origin server. The accelerated domain name is mapped to its CNAME, which is resolved to an invalid IP addressoffline.\*\*\*.com. In this case, the accelerated domain name is inaccessible.

**Solution**: Apply for an ICP number for the accelerated domain name. Then, [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.2020520001.aliyun_topbar.18.dbd44bd3e4f845#/ticket/createIndex) to enable the accelerated domain name.

## Enable a manually disabled accelerated domain name

**Problem description**: You can manually disable an accelerated domain name. After an accelerated domain name is disabled, the state of the accelerated domain name is changed to OFFLINE.

**Impacts**:

-   In normal cases: An accelerated domain name is mapped to a CNAME assigned by Alibaba Cloud CDN. The CNAME is resolved to the IP address of a CDN node.
-   Impacts: After you disable an accelerated domain name, content delivery acceleration is immediately suspended for the accelerated domain name. The domain name is mapped to its CNAME, which is resolved to an invalid IP address.

**Solution**: To enable an accelerated domain name, perform the following steps: Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud CDN console](https://cdn.console.aliyun.com) and click Domain Names in the left-side navigation pane. On the Domain Names page, select the accelerated domain name that you want to enable and click **Enable**.
