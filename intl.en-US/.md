# Rules for disabling domain names for CDN

You can disable your domain names that are added to Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\). In some scenarios, your domain names for CDN can be disabled by Alibaba Cloud CDN due to service violation, overdue payment, or invalid Internet Content Provider \(ICP\) filing. This topic describes the resolution rules for disabled domain names for CDN and how to enable the domain names again.

## Service violation

**Problem description**: Your domain name for CDN is blocked because it does not comply with the [limits](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/27114.html) that Alibaba Cloud CDN imposes on domain names. In this case, your domain name for CDN is disabled. In addition, the system sends notifications to you by using text messages or emails.

**Resolution rule for a disabled domain name for CDN**: Alibaba Cloud CDN deletes the canonical name \(CNAME\) that is assigned to the domain name and stops resolving the domain name. In this case, the domain name is inaccessible. In addition, the domain name is added to the blacklist. You cannot add it to Alibaba Cloud CDN again in the Alibaba Cloud CDN console.

**Solution**: Make sure that the domain name for CDN complies with the [limits](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/27114.html) that Alibaba Cloud CDN imposes on domain names. Then, [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.2020520001.aliyun_topbar.18.dbd44bd3e4f845#/ticket/createIndex) to bring an appeal.

## Overdue payment

**Problem description**: If the available credit of your Alibaba Cloud account is less than the payable amount on the bill, your bill is overdue. The available credit includes the account balance, vouchers, coupons, and credit of the [extended suspension service](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/190777.html?spm=a2c81.e70476c.0.dexternal.201e1127SH773V) within your account. In this case, your domain name for CDN is disabled. In addition, the system sends text messages or emails to notify you of the overdue payment.

**Resolution rule for a disabled domain name for CDN**:

-   In normal cases: A domain name for CDN is resolved to the IP address that belongs to an Alibaba Cloud CDN node by using a CNAME.
-   Within the next 720 hours after a domain name for CDN is disabled because of the overdue payment: When you receive text messages or emails that notify you of the overdue payment, Alibaba Cloud CDN disables the domain name for CDN. The status of the domain name is changed to OFFLINE. Within the next 720 hours after the domain name for CDN is disabled, the domain name is resolved to the origin server by using the CNAME.
-   After the domain name for CDN is disabled for 720 hours because of the overdue payment: Alibaba Cloud CDN stops resolving the domain name to the origin server. The domain name is resolved to an invalid domain name offline.\*\*\*.com by using the CNAME. In this case, the domain name is inaccessible.

**Solution**: Settle the payment. After that, you must manually enable the domain name for CDN in the OFFLINE state again.

## Invalid ICP filing

**Problem description**: When the ICP filing of your domain name for CDN becomes invalid, the system sends text messages or emails to notify you that you must obtain an ICP filing.

**Note:**

-   The ICP filing of a domain name becomes invalid if the information of the ICP filing entity changes. The information includes but not limited to the ICP filing owner, receiving channels of notifications, service provider, website, and website service. In this case, if you check the ICP filing status of the domain name, the domain name does not have an ICP filing.
-   If your Alibaba Cloud CDN service is deployed in a region in mainland China, your domain name must have an ICP filing.

**Resolution rule for a disabled domain name for CDN**:

-   In normal cases: A domain name for CDN is resolved to the IP address that belongs to an Alibaba Cloud CDN node by using a CNAME.
-   Within the next 168 hours after a domain name for CDN is disabled because of its invalid ICP filing: When the ICP filing of a domain name for CDN becomes invalid, Alibaba Cloud CDN disables the domain name. The status of the domain name is changed to OFFLINE. Within the next 168 hours after the domain name for CDN is disabled, the domain name is resolved to the origin server by using the CNAME.
-   After the domain name for CDN is disabled for 168 hours because of its invalid ICP filing: Alibaba Cloud CDN stops resolving the domain name to the origin server. The domain name is resolved to an invalid domain name offline.\*\*\*.com by using the CNAME. In this case, the domain name is inaccessible.

**Solution**: Make sure that you have applied for an ICP filing for the domain name. Then, [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.2020520001.aliyun_topbar.18.dbd44bd3e4f845#/ticket/createIndex) to bring an appeal.

## Intentional operation

**Problem description**: You can disable a domain name for CDN that is no longer needed.

**Resolution rule for a disabled domain name for CDN**:

-   In normal cases: A domain name for CDN is resolved to the IP address that belongs to an Alibaba Cloud CDN node by using a CNAME.
