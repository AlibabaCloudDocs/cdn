# Activate Alibaba Cloud CDN

You must activate Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\) before you can use this service. This topic describes how to activate Alibaba Cloud CDN.

[Alibaba Cloud account registration](https://account.alibabacloud.com/register/intl_register.htm) and [real-name verification](https://account-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/intlAuth) are completed.

**Note:** The users at the International site \(alibabacloud.com\) must complete real-name verification in the following scenarios:

-   Based on the laws and the regulations in mainland China, real-name verification is required for the users who purchase and use cloud services that are deployed on the nodes in mainland China. The users are categorized into existing users, new users, and the users who renew the services.
-   If you select a region in mainland China when you purchase a cloud service, the system checks the information that is provided for real-name verification. If you do not complete real-name verification for your account, you must first complete it.
