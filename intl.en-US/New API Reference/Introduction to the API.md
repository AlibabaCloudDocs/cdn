# Introduction to the API

Alibaba Cloud provides a wide array of API operations available for use in Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\).

Before you call the Alibaba Cloud CDN API, make sure that you have read and understand the product introduction, terms of service, and billing rules. For more information, see [What is Alibaba Cloud CDN?](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/What is Alibaba Cloud CDN?.md) and [Billing of basic services](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing method/Billing of basic services.md).

The latest version of the Alibaba Cloud CDN API is 2018-05-10.

For more information, see [List of operations by function](/intl.en-US/New API Reference/List of operations by function.md).

**Note:** The earlier version \(2014-11-11\) of the Alibaba Cloud CDN API is no longer maintained. We recommend that you use the latest version of the Alibaba Cloud CDN API.

In June 2021, Alibaba Cloud will discontinue API operations that have not been called within the last two months. If you have questions, [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.2020520001.aliyun_topbar.18.dbd44bd3e4f845#/ticket/createIndex). List of API operations:
