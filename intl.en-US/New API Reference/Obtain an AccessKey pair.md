# Obtain an AccessKey pair

This topic describes how to create an AccessKey pair for an Alibaba Cloud account or Resource Access Management \(RAM\) user. When you call the Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\) API, you must use the AccessKey pair to complete identity verification.

An AccessKey pair consists of an AccessKey ID and an AccessKey secret.

-   The AccessKey ID is used to verify the identity of a user.
-   The AccessKey secret is used to encrypt and verify the signature string for identity authentication. You must keep your AccessKey secret strictly confidential.

**Warning:** If the AccessKey pair of your Alibaba Cloud account is leaked, the security of your resources will be compromised. We recommend that you use the AccessKey pair of a RAM user to call API operations. This minimizes the risks of leaking the AccessKey pair of your Alibaba Cloud account.
