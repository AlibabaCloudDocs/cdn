# Overview

Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\) provides multiple optimization features for you to improve the acceleration performance of content delivery. For example, you can use these features to reduce the size of the requested files. This improves the acceleration performance and readability of the requested web pages.

Alibaba Cloud CDN provides the following optimization features.

|Feature|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|[Configure HTML optimization](/intl.en-US/Domain Management/Performance optimization/Configure HTML optimization.md)|This feature enables Alibaba Cloud CDN to automatically remove redundant content from web pages, such as comments and additional whitespace characters in HTML pages and CSS or JavaScript code. This reduces file sizes, accelerates content delivery, and improves website readability.|
|[Configure intelligent compression](/intl.en-US/Domain Management/Performance optimization/Configure intelligent compression.md)|This feature enables CDN nodes to use Gzip to compress text files before they are returned to users. This reduces the size of requested files, accelerates content delivery, and reduces bandwidth usage.|
|[Configure Brotli compression](/intl.en-US/Domain Management/Performance optimization/Configure Brotli compression.md)|This feature enables CDN nodes to use Brotli to compress text files before they are returned to users. This reduces the size of requested files, accelerates content delivery, and reduces bandwidth usage.|
|[Image editing](/intl.en-US/Domain Management/Performance optimization/Image editing/Overview.md)|This feature edits and distributes images on CDN nodes. This simplifies the back-to-origin process, reduces the number of requests that are redirected to origin servers, and reduces loads on origin servers.|
|[Retain URL parameters](/intl.en-US/Domain Management/Performance optimization/Retain URL parameters.md)|This feature enables Alibaba Cloud CDN to ignore parameters that follow the question mark \(?\)from URLs. This increases the cache hit ratio, reduces the number of requests that are redirected to origin servers, reduces the amount of network traffic generated by the back-to-origin process, and accelerates content delivery. You can specify the parameters that you want to retain in URLs.|
|[Delete URL parameters](/intl.en-US/Domain Management/Performance optimization/Delete URL parameters.md)|This feature enables Alibaba Cloud CDN to ignore parameters that follow the question mark \(?\)from URLs. This increases the cache hit ratio, reduces the number of requests that are redirected to origin servers, reduces the amount of network traffic generated by the back-to-origin process, and accelerates content delivery. You can specify the parameters that you want to ignore or retain.|
