# Set an alert rule

This topic describes how to create an alert rule in the Cloud Monitor console. Alert rules can be used to monitor peak bandwidth values, proportions of the HTTP 4xx or 5xx status code, hit ratios, inbound traffic, and the number of queries per second of accelerated domain names. When an alert rule is triggered, Cloud Monitor sends notifications to you through SMS or emails.
