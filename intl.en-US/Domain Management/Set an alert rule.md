# Set an alert rule

This topic describes how to create an alert rule in the CloudMonitor console. Alert rules can be used to monitor peak bandwidth values, proportions of the HTTP 4xx and 5xx status codes, hit ratios, outbound network traffic, and the number of queries per second of accelerated domain names. When an alert rule is triggered, CloudMonitor notifies you by text messages or emails.

1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud CDN console](https://cdn.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Domain Names**.

3.  On the **Domain Names** page, click **CloudMonitor** to go to the CloudMonitor console.
