# Configure IPv6 settings

This topic describes how to configure IPv6 settings in the Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\) console. After you enable IPv6, clients can send IPv6 requests to CDN nodes. Requests that are redirected to origin servers also carry the IPv6 information of the client.

Most CDN nodes support IPv6. You can enable the IPv6 feature for an accelerated domain name on the domain name management page.

After you enable IPv6, clients can send IPv6 requests to the nearest CDN nodes if they are deployed in an IPv6 network and the CDN nodes support IPv6. If the nearest CDN nodes do not support IPv6, the clients can send IPv4 requests to the CDN nodes.

**Note:** CDN nodes that are deployed in regions outside mainland China, including China \(Hong Kong\), China \(Macao\), and China \(Taiwan\), do not support IPv6.

1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud CDN console](https://cdn.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Domain Names**.

3.  On the Domain Names page, find the target domain name and click **Manage**.

4.  Click the **IPv6 Settings** tab.

5.  Turn on the **IPv6** switch.

    After you enable IPv6, clients can send IPv6 requests to CDN nodes. Requests that are redirected to origin servers also carry the IPv6 information of the clients.
