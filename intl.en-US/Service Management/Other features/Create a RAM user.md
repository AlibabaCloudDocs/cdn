# Create a RAM user

You can create Resource Access Management \(RAM\) users and grant these RAM users limited permissions to manage resources of different departments for domain names added to Alibaba Cloud Content Delivery Network \(CDN\). This topic describes how to create a RAM user.

1.  Create a RAM user.

    For more information, see [Create a RAM user](/intl.en-US/RAM User Management/Create a RAM user.md).

2.  \(Optional\) Customize permission policies for Alibaba Cloud CDN.

    If a RAM user requires more permissions other than the default permissions AliyunCDNFullAccess and AliyunCDNReadOnlyAccess, you can create permission policies for the RAM user. For more information, see [Use RAM to manage Alibaba Cloud CDN permissions](/intl.en-US/Tutorials/Use RAM to manage Alibaba Cloud CDN permissions.md).

3.  Log on to the Alibaba Cloud CDN console as the RAM user.

    URL: http://signin.aliyun.com/Custom domain.onaliyun.com/login.htm.

    RAM users cannot use the [DCDN](/intl.en-US/Service Management/DCDN.md) feature. They can use other features in the same way as with an Alibaba Cloud account.
